an euro front panel for don buchlas single resonant lowpass gate pcb by thomas white

this is a set of files that can be used to make a front panel for the pcb from <https://naturalrhythmmusic.com/lopass/>.
It uses the additional features on the pcb like deep switch and the audio and cv summing inputs.
The current layout features a

	* 3-input attenuated audio mixer

	* Deep Switch

	* 3-input, 2 attenuated cv mixer and the inverted cv out.


To make a panel, expose a 12TE wide alucorex panel to UV light using the files included and develop as usual. The drilling holes for the pots are designed for Alps RK112Kxx.

TODO:
the audio input one is a bit close to cv attenuator 3
